Acquisition, Development, and Representation of Linguistic Knowledge

 

INFORMED CONSENT FORM

You are invited to participate in a research study that is being conducted by Dr. Kristen Syrett, an Associate Professor in the Department of Linguistics and the Center for Cognitive Science at Rutgers University – New Brunswick. The purpose of this research is to investigate what children and adults understand about aspects of meaning in their native language and how this knowledge is acquired.

 

In this study, we will ask you to read some words or sentences, or look at some images or videos. You will be asked to provide your judgment about these materials, make a selection given certain instructions, or follow the experimenter’s directions to perform some action with the materials. Your reaction time may be monitored. You may provide your consent to be audio and/or video-recorded. Over the course of this particular study, approximately 20 to 100 participants will participate. The study lasts between 10 and 20 minutes.

 

Participation in this study is voluntary. You will be minimally compensated ($5) for your participation in this study, as specified on the site running the study. While your linguistic skills are not likely to improve from participation in this research, your responses may provide us with valuable data about the process of child language acquisition and development, and the nature of the adult grammar and language processor.

 

There are no foreseeable risks to participation in this study. You may choose not to participate, and you may withdraw at any time during the study procedures without any penalty to you. In addition, you may choose not to answer any questions with which you are not entirely comfortable.

 

This research is confidential. Confidential means that we will collect information from you, including your gender, age, race and ethnicity, other expertise, and possibly your IP address, which will remain on file. This information will not be used to identify you in any way, and your IP address will not be used for any purposes other than to ensure that you do not participate in the same study twice. We use this information to understand more about our findings and the factors involved in language development and comprehension. Responses and demographic information are collected for all participants and analyzed to report trends across participants. This information will be stored in such a manner that some link between your identity and responses in the research will exist. You will be assigned an arbitrary code that will be associated with your data. Should an individual response be used as example, personal identifying information will be removed beforehand. Please note that we will keep this information confidential by limiting access to the research data and keeping it in a secure location in our lab. All electronic files are password-protected.

 

Our research team and the Institutional Review Board at Rutgers University are the only parties that will be allowed to see the data, except as may be required by law. If a report of this study is published, or the results are presented at a professional conference, no results that can be linked to an individual will be presented. All study data will be kept for the duration of the study and its publication for a finite period of time between three and ten years.
